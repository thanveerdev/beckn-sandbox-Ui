## TL;DR

### Backend Setup
-   Set BPP Client URL and Base URL in .env
-   Run `npm install` and `npm run start:dev` to start sandbox
-   Set the `client.webhook.url` field in BPP Client config/default.yml to the address of this sandbox installation. (Previously you needed to configure a software called beckn-sandbox-webhook. That software is not required anymore.)

### Frontend Demo
-   Open `beckn-demo.html` in your browser for an interactive demonstration
-   No additional installation required - works out of the box
-   Demonstrates all Beckn domains with mock API responses

## Project Introduction/Overview

A sandbox environment typically replicates the necessary components of the production system but operates independently. It may include a separate server, database, network, and other resources. By isolating the sandbox environment from the production system, any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered during testing can be addressed without affecting live users or critical data.

## Installation/Setup and User Guide

### Backend Installation

You can access the detailed Backend Installation and User Guide from [here](https://github.com/beckn/beckn-sandbox/blob/main/USER_GUIDE.md).

### Frontend Demo Installation

#### Quick Start (Recommended)
1. **Open the Interactive Demo:**
   ```bash
   open beckn-demo.html
   ```
   Or simply double-click the `beckn-demo.html` file in your file explorer.

2. **Explore Beckn Domains:**
   - Select any domain card (Mobility, Tourism, Retail, Healthcare, Education, Logistics)
   - Fill in the search parameters
   - View real-time Beckn API responses

#### Features of the Frontend Demo
- **üåê Multi-Domain Support**: Demonstrates 6 key Beckn domains
- **üîç Interactive Search**: Domain-specific search forms with real-time responses
- **üì± Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **üéØ Educational**: Built-in explanations of Beckn protocol concepts
- **‚ö° No Setup Required**: Pure HTML/JavaScript - runs in any modern browser

#### Advanced Frontend Development
If you want to develop a more advanced React-based frontend:

1. **Create React Frontend:**
   ```bash
   npx create-vite@latest beckn-frontend --template react-ts
   cd beckn-frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Install Additional Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install axios @types/node
   ```

3. **Start Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Configure API Endpoint:**
   Update the base URL in your API service to point to the running Beckn sandbox:
   ```typescript
   const baseUrl = 'http://localhost:3000';
   ```

#### Frontend Architecture
The demo showcases:
- **Unified API Structure**: Same request/response format across all domains
- **Context-Aware Searches**: Location and domain-specific parameters
- **Beckn Protocol Compliance**: Proper context, message, and catalog structures
- **Mock Data Integration**: Realistic responses for demonstration purposes
